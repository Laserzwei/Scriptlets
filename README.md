# Scriptlets
### currently contains:
1. loot unlocker: A small script to unbind loot from players (others can collect it)
2. module viewer: Allows to remotely view and modify(= add/remove) any module of another player/Alliance/Faction
3. punisher: Transfers Money and Resources from one player to another. Let's the punished player have some to still play the game, but every excess resource will be given to the other player.
4. relation helper: Mitigates relation penalties from shield hits. Reduces some relation drops from Hull-damage delt, but is not perfect.
